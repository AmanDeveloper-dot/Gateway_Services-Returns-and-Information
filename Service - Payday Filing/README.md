# Payday filing through Gateway Services

Payday filing through our gateway services lets employers:
* file employment information (EI) to us each pay cycle instead of monthly using the Return service
* â€¢	send changes to employee details (ED) using the Employment service.

There is currently no gateway method for employer deductions payment.

## [Employment information Software Development Kit (SDK)](Employment%20Information)

Employment information includes employee's income and deduction information for each pay cycle. 
If businesses use payroll software they must submit this to us within two working days of the payday.

## [Employee details Software Development Kit (SDK)](Employee%20Details)

Employers will also need to submit through their software additional details for new and departing employees. This must be before the next employment information due date.
The employment information application programming interface (API) lets employers send us this information each pay cycle.
